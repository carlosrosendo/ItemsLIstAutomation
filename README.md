# ItemsListAutomation

This is an example of code that can select items by creating a list and verifying that the items we name are all checked for. It was created utilizing Selenium Webdriver, Java, Eclipse, Maven. 

You can observe how different web elements are selected and the page changes it's views until we are able to call the method that contains our code for selecting the items named in the list.
